%   An example of how to use the cross-validation kernel smoother in
%   MATLAB. In this example we simulate a "true rate" which is a scaled
%   sinusoid. From this rate we generate spikes using an inhomogeneous
%   Poisson model. Using only the spikes, we estimate the true rate. Our
%   estimate is shown in red, and the true rate is shown in dashhed gray.
%
%   We show and example of estimating rates from two simulated rate
%   functions--one with a large bandwidth, and one with a small bandwidth
