%                         ï¿½ Michael J. Prerau, Ph.D. 2011
%
%   This code is derived from the algorithm in:
%   Prerau M.J., Eden U.T.
%   "A General Likelihood Framework for Characterizing the Time Course of Neural Activity",
%   Journal of Neuroscience, 2011
%
%   Performs hanning kernel smoothing using cross validation on the
%   kernel smoother used on spiking
%
%   USAGE:
%       [estimate kmax loglikelihoods bandwidths]=cvkernel(spikeTrain, dt)
%                                      or
%       [estimate kmax loglikelihoods bandwidths]=cvkernel(spikeTrain, dt, range)
%                                      or
%       [estimate kmax loglikelihoods bandwidths]=cvkernel(spikeTrain, dt, range, ploton)
%
%   INPUTS:
%       spikeTrain is the 1xN vector of spike counts
%       dt is the sampling rate (in seconds) of spikeTrain
%
%     Optional:
%       range is a 1xV vector that specifies the range of bandwidths to use in the
%           cross-validation. This vector the units of this vector is number of
%           dt sized time bins and all values should be odd. (Default: [3:2:N])
%       ploton is 1 for a figure showing the estimate and bandwidth
%           likelihood with confidence bounds, (Default: 0)
%
%   OUTPUTS:
%       estimate is the estimate of the nonparametric regression/rate
%       kmax is the bandwidth with the maximum likelihood
%       loglikelihoods is a vector of log-likelihood values for each kernel
%           bandwidth
%       bandwidths is a 1xV vector number of dt sized time bins used for the bandwith
%           at each iteration of the cross-validation
%       CI is a 1x2 vector of estimated 95% confidence bounds from the Fisher
%           information on the bandwidth size
%
%   EXAMPLE:
%       Run "cvexample.m" for an example of the cross-validated kernel
%       smoother used on spiking data.
